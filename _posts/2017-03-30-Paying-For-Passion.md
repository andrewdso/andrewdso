Everything about samurai sounds badass. Fancy swords. Fancy armor. Code of honor.

During Japan's feudal period, land-owning lords called daimyo hired them as mercenary servants. But if their master dies, or they lose their master's favor, they're no longer called samurai- they're called Ronin. The term literally means wanderer. And while being a samurai is badass, being a Ronin was shameful.

They trained their whole lives to become expert swordsmen. Practicing hand-to-hand combat. Learning military tactics. But without someone to serve, it's easy to feel like you have no purpose. What good is a sword that remains in its sheath?

In modern times, the Japanese call unemployed people Ronin. And like in ancient times, it's a shameful term. Despite this, I love how it implies someone is still skilled. They're just seeking a purpose for their skill. 

The relationship between samurai and daimyo is the same as any between employer and employee- "Give me money and I'll do shit for you."

Without a contract between them, they're just strangers. Their problems are their own. Their lives are their own. 

But after a samurai goes through a loyalty ceremony, he will care deeply for the master's estate. Kill on his behalf. Even die for his master. 

One of the strangest things about American work culture is "hiring for passion". Nobody in their right mind is passionate about marketing channel analytics software. Or reading legal briefs. Or any type of customer service.

Of course, whoever founded the company will be passionate about it. And maybe the first dozen hires are passionate. How else could you recruit someone to build a company about something boring?

If you're hiring for passion, you'll end up with the best liars. The trick isn't to look for candidates passionate about your company. If you hire skilled people, and give them a direction for their skill, only then do they begin to care about your company.

Skilled people are special because they give a shit. They had the patience to spend years practicing their craft. They experimented with new techniques, persevered through failure, and gained wisdom from experts. They're people that are naturally driven by passion, by a sense of purpose. Treat them well and they'll live and die for you.
