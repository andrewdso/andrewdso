I graduated high school during the same time as the second dot-com boom, during the social media phase and iphone apps stage of startups. Mark Zuckerberg was like the king of startups. He was a brilliant college dropout that wore hoodies and shorts running a multi-million dollar business. Everyone I know wanted to be the next Zuckerberg.

The Zuck we see today, the mild-mannered, benevolent-sounding visionary is totally different from the one I remember. Unfortunately for him, the 2010 film The Social Network immortalized his bad behavior during his startup's early days. 

As much as he pioneered the social media and tech space, he also had a proufound effect on the culture of tech as a whole especially in Silicon Valley. All the hoodies, frat parties, and asshole-ness: he brought that in. If Steve Jobs made it fashionable to be a ruthless business asshole (at least that's how he was portrayed), Zuck and especially Jesse Eisenberg's portrayal of Zuck made it cool to be a tech bro asshole. 

Over the past decade several college dropouts that have built unicorns- companies valued at over one billion dollars. I believe that in the next ten years we'll see high school dropouts doing the same. 

The problem is that college is useful as a buffer period for children to make mistakes without major repercussions to their career (at least that's what it used to be). They can explore subjects they're interested in, they can meet new people from different backgrounds, they can act stupid, like children. Especially among super bright students, they didn't have much time in high school because they were always studying. So when they enter college they have freedom from their parents and they can party and do all sorts of dumb shit.
