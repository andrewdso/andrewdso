I graduated high school during the same time as the second dot-com boom, during the social media phase and iphone apps stage of startups. Mark Zuckerberg was like the king of startups. He was a brilliant college dropout that wore hoodies and shorts running a multi-million dollar business. Everyone I know wanted to be the next Zuckerberg.

The Zuck we see today, the mild-mannered, benevolent-sounding visionary is totally different from the one I remember. Unfortunately for him, the 2010 film The Social Network immortalized his bad behavior during his startup's early days.
