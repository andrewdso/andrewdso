Bitcion is going to revolutionize banking. I by that I mean it's going to do everything the same but from square one.

So what's the point of a bank. Fundamentally, it's someplace you store money and the entity loans out the money, collecting interest. Bitcoin solves the issue of storing money. It's in wallets. But what about lending money? Where do ppl go if they want to borrow money if the crypto-anarchists get their way and destroy all the current financial establishments.

Well then we'll go back to the predecessor of the bank.

Tokens raised by individuals to bet on their future still based on quantitative measure + trust future of education? crowdfunding individuals

Everyone that's bought bitcoin and hedl has made money. But let's say fiat disappears, or becomes a backup and crpyto becomes the dominant finance. 

What do poor people do when they need to borrow money? Ideally you'll have a global marketplace of lenders since the entire ecosystem is P2P rather than B2C. So you any one person can lend to any one person.

But even though everyone is accessible, there needs to be trust that guarantees that a lender will repay. In physical money days, lenders were local so a loanshark had many a dozen-hundred clients. If they didn't pay then you repossessed their stuff or beat them up a bit. 

But the physical constraints change that. The current system analyzes a person's financial past to estimate their likelihood of paying you back. And I like that system. I don't like how it's implemented.

So I'm talking about credit score. So how it works now is three national credit bureaus: Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion have every since piece of info about you in a big-ass database and crunch the numbers to give you a credit score. 

So since the whole point of P2P is to cut out "trusted" 3rd parties (lol Equifax trusted), how do you analyze the trustworthiness of a person and thus how likelihood to pay you back? 

The system of bitcoin is 'trustless' in that you don't need a 3rd party to verify the validity of a digital transaction. But you do need the trust to determine who someone is, and if they should be getting your money.
